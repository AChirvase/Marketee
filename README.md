# Marketee
#### This is a demo project.


## What was aked for:

Please find attached a list of marketing channels with targeting specifics and several marketing  campaign fees for each of them.  
Our client needs an MVP application which will have the following functionalities (flows/steps):  1. Listing of the targeting specifics where he is allowed to multiple choose  2. Listing of the channels which offer his selected specifics. He can select any channel  
3. Listing of the campaigns available for the channel, with monthly fees and details for each  campaign. This step will allow him to select any campaign (single selection) or reset to no  selection.  
4. Return to the previous (2) listing where he can repeat step 3  
5. Review the campaign(s) which he selected.  
6. The final step will send an email with the selected campaigns details to a bogus email  (bogus@bogus.com).  
All screens design, screen transitions, listing type are up to your imagination.  (Bonus points for retrieving the datasources from a free json hosting service)
